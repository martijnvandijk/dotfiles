# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles Martijn van Dijk and Alexander Freeman are using at the moment.

# Managing the dotfiles

Installing the dotfiles can be done easily using GNU stow. Just run ```stow <FOLDER>``` to install the corresponding
dotfiles. Stow creates symlinks to the correct locations, so when you update the repo it will update the dotfiles
accordingly.
